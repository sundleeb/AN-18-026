% >> Date
% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been
% redefined to match, but if the date needs to be fixed, please write it in this fashion.
% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.
% For the final version it is best to "touch" the head file to make sure it has the latest date.
\date{\today}

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: CDS MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_ will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{
We present a search for events with a signature characterized by large
missing transverse energy and a boosted Higgs boson that has decayed
into a pair of bottom quarks in pp collisions at a center-of-mass
energy of 13 TeV in a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36\,$\text{fb}^{-1}$. Observations are interpreted in terms of new particles and couplings in various theoretical scenarios that predict such signatures in the context of Beyond Standard Model physics and associated Dark Matter production.  Upper bounds on the production cross sections of such scenarios are placed.

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:
% (1) no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
% (2) no %.
% (3) No curly braces {}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Begin text %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% **DO NOT REMOVE THE BIBLIOGRAPHY** which is located before the appendix.
%% You can take the text between here and the bibiliography as an example which you should replace with the actual text of your document.
%% If you include other TeX files, be sure to use "\input{filename}" rather than "\input filename".
%% The latter works for you, but our parser looks for the braces and will break when uploading the document.
